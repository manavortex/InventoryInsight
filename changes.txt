v1.??

- materials no longer show up differently depending on what level they
have (for some reason ZO has decided that materials have a
level rating in them, even though level in a material has no bearing on
anything)
- all code associated with "worn" indicators removed
- stolen items will now display tooltips for non-stolen versions
